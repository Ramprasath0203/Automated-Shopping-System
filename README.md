# Automated-Shopping-System
The Automated shopping system idea is based on the most popular automated self- checkout system in most of the retail stores in Europe. The concept of our project is also inspired from the same. Our aim is to develop an automated self-checkout system within a trolley along with a user interface to scan the items while being placed in the trolley and making payment for the products placed before leaving the store.

The architecture used here blends Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and wireless technology to provide ‘on spot’ billing in supermarkets. It uses the RFID based system application in the shopping trolley and the RFID card which is used as a security access for the product. The bill is transmitted to the server end through the Wi- Fi technology which in turn connects to the mobile and thus. The software simulation is
 
done using Proteus software and hardware is implemented using a microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi). Also, we have proposed another idea which is completely based on mobile phones starting from scanning to billing.

Also, there are other additional features that will be included in the design such as locating an item in the store by typing in the item’s name in the search field on the user interface screen which will automatically show the item’s location in the store.

The Automated shopping system is also designed with security measures to prevent it being wheeled out from the store’s premises thus avoiding theft and is designed in such a way to protect the customers card details.
